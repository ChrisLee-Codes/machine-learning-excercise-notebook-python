Why Protect?              

All companies succeed on the basis of what they know, create, design or invent. This is all valuable intellectual property (IP) that is, for many, their most prized asset.

In particular, start ups and small businesses want to cost effectively protect their valuable intellectual assets.

An unprecedented opportunity to meet world class expertise

For the first time, members of the Science & Technology Park community will be able to meet and talk to:

A creator of successful, world class processes to protect the valuable IP of a major corporation (TSMC)

A key driver of IP and innovation policies at the US Patent and Trademark Office

 

These distinguished leaders in the IP field will talk about the importance of IP today, cost effectively protecting IP and why companies must now pay special attention to the most valuable and often overlooked IP - trade secrets and databases.
